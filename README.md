- Hi, I’m @bbflunkie
- I’m interested in iOS and Android in an Enterprise setting
- I’m currently learning GitHub and Jira
- I worked with a number of 8-bit computers in the early 80's, and that interest has come back with a vengeance :)
- I've restored my original VIC 20, Commodore 64, and the later Commodore 128's, along with my first IBM PC
- There were many PC's of all shapes and sizes between then and now
- I'm looking at the Commander X16, waiting for my Developer version
